# feathers-nuxt-starter


## About

This is a starter template for [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/) in the server and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) in client. Later on vue.js client also will be added.
For datastore, mySql have been used.

## Getting Started

First make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed also you have [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and its running. Personally I'm using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) on mac.

1. Download or clone this repo.

2. Install your dependencies of both server and client directories

    ```
    cd path/to/feathers-nuxt-starter/server && npm install
    cd path/to/feathers-nuxt-starter/client && npm install
    ```

3. Start server

    ```
    npm rund dev # With auto reload on file changes
    ```

4. Start client

    ```
    npm rund dev # With Hot Module Replacement
    ```

You can find more details in each directory.
